title: more about fanfiction (this time, at fsnna)!
---

I will be giving a paper & poster presentation at the Fan Studies Network North America conference this October! This is new work on fanfiction from two course projects (computational + close-reading) I did in Spring for Dynamic Network Analysis and Intertextuality. I consider it still in-progress and am going to keep refining this, so I am grateful to get to speak about it (and learn from others) at FSNNA! I'd also like to thank Professor Carley and Professor Oddo for their support and advice during the semester ✦︎
