A paper based on work I did for my master's has [just been published](https://journalqd.org/article/view/8604/7429)! It's been a while since that period of my life - and this paper itself has seen many lives through the constant revisions I've put it through. Many thanks to Professor Ringo and Professor Kokil who saw me through the rehauling of this work; they've helped me very much in penning out this final version of my earliest computational work.
