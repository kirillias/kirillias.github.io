I presented my [working paper on character representations between fan communities](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11170) as a poster at SBP-BRiMS today! It's a small paper (but very close to my heart) refined from some fun informal analyses I did on weekends/nights and shared on Tumblr some years ago - specifically a couple that had resonated quite a bit with other fans (thank you!!)
