<h2>hi there!ðŸ˜¸</h2>
<div style="text-align: justify; padding: 10px;background-color: #ff6973;border:5px solid black;">
I'm a first-year Societal Computing Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), supervised by <a href="http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/bios/carley/carley.html"><font color="#46425e"><b>Professor Kathleen Carley</b></font></a>. I'm broadly interested in <b>sociolinguistics</b>, <b>cultural analytics</b>, and <b>social network analysis</b>. I'm particularly keen on exploring <b>how online communities construct representations and identities</b> for the things they talk about and themselves, across various contexts (news, conspiracies, fandom).</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">
<br><small>Before coming to CMU, I worked in information research at the Defence Science and Technology Agency in Singapore. I did my Master of Arts (Research) in Psychology at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) with a focus on computational social science, supervised by <a href="https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp00375">Professor Ringo Ho</a> - my thesis analyzed the correlates of and gendered differences in repeat advice-seeking behavior on Reddit. In the even more distant past, I was a full-time research assistant in a lab situated between the Nanyang Business School and School of Social Sciences at NTU. I did my undergraduate at the National University of Singapore, where I majored in Psychology and was part of the University Scholars Programme.</small>
