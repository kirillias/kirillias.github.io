<div style="text-align: justify">
<font size=4 px>I have a lot of room in my heart for fanfiction, fanart, and online communities in general! I'm also a long-time MMO player and am currently on FFXIV. I enjoy RPGs, roguelites, and the occasional rhythm game too. Outside of that, I do digital art (read: fanart) and have started dabbling in low-poly pixel and voxel art. I'm also learning a third language!</font><br>
